<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Guardian of the Galaxy is a shooter game inspired by the guardian of the Galaxy movie. The game is browser based, and designed on the Phaser 3 game library. The game uses a collection of amazing art designed by various game designers from OpenGameArt website( Please Refer to the acknowlegment section for more Informations). The main goal of this game is to score the highest possible score, while killing invading alien ships.

## Live Demo

Click [ here ](https://gallant-wescoff-7173eb.netlify.app) for a live demo of the app.

## Game Developement Process

The app had a five day deadline. What follows is a breakdown of how I was able to utilize the five days in delivering the game.

1. Day-one: Deep dive on Phaser-3 documentation and supplementery tutorials.
2. Day-two: Game Desing. With the help of Open Game Art webiste, I was able to reuse some of the phaser sprites and game mechanics under the free the license in exchange of acknowledging the author.
3. Third-day: I was able to start curving out the game scenes based on my sprite template.
4. Fourth-day: Finalizing on the major section of the game.
5. Testing and documenting the game.

Despite having a 5 day deadline, the time frame wasn't enough to implement all the objectives of the game, as scheduled before. Here are some of the missing functionalities:

- Game optimization for speed

I was However, able to implement the core game functionalities.

- Player, Enemy Motions and Interactions.
- Player Score
- Leader's Board using external api( which is a well curated list of the players with the best scores)
- Game audio and cool sound effects.

## Features

- Player username Input
- Leader Board listing the first 10 player with the highest score.

## Future Functionalities

- more animations.
- Player health status
