<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![](./images/demo.gif)weather_app

The app is built using native javascript api and Phaser (A game Library). The main aim of this app was to test the learner's ability to quickly adapt to new emerging technologies and in the long rand, be able to deliver the target project within the specified time constraint. This also ensure that the learner is able to adapt to the fast paced environment of the software development world.

## Live Demo

Click [ here ](https://gallant-wescoff-7173eb.netlify.app) for a live demo of the app.

## Game Developement Process

The app had a five day deadline. What follows is a breakdown of how I was able to utilize the five days in delivering the game.

1. Day-one: Deep dive on Phaser-3 documentation and supplementery tutorials.
2. Day-two: Game Desing. With the help of Open Game Art webiste, I was able to reuse some of the phaser sprites and game mechanics under the free the license in exchange of acknowledging the author.
3. Third-day: I was able to start curving out the game scenes based on my sprite template.
4. Fourth-day: Finalizing on the major section of the game.
5. Testing and documenting the game.

Despite having a 5 day deadline, the time frame wasn't enough to implement all the objectives of the game, as scheduled before. Here are some of the missing functionalities:

- Game optimization for speed

I was However, able to implement the core game functionalities.

- Player, Enemy Motions and Interactions.
- Player Score
- Leader's Board using external api( which is a well curated list of the players with the best scores)
- Game audio and cool sound effects.

## Features

- Player username Input
- Leader Board listing the first 10 player with the highest score.

## Future Functionalities

- more animations.
- Player health status
